ogDescription: Introducing the Purdue Hackers passports.

We spent 3 months designing & prototyping a passport for Purdue Hackers. Today, we want to share it with you.

The Purdue Hackers passport is a physical, passport-shaped booklet, containing a "data page" with its owner's information, and 16 pages for stamps.

Passports are handmade by their owners at hour-long passport-making ceremonies, which run every two weeks at Hack Night. Hackers sign up for a passport-making ceremony by [creating their personalized data page](https://passports.purduehackers.com).

Every week we laser cut a new stamp, and hackers get their passports stamped at Hack Night.

Every passport has an NFC sticker embedded in its cover, which has an ID written to it. This NFC sticker is the heart of a passport: it allows it to become a legitimate identifying document within our universe, and unique infrastructure to be built around it.

Passports have two goals:

### 1. Give hackers a physical keepsake from their time in college

We believe this is a uniquely special period of our lives, and we want to create long-lasting, detailed documentation of it. The [Hack Night badges](https://arc.net/l/quote/vnenuxsq) are one way we do this, and we want passports to be another way. We want hackers to keep their passports with them forever, their data pages and stamps serving as vivid reminders of their time in Purdue Hackers.

### 2. Allow hackers to become "card-carrying members" of Purdue Hackers

We want passports to level you up as a member of Purdue Hackers. Having a passport signals that you are willing to spend an hour handcrafting it, and once you have one you can show it to others as a badge of honor—a physical indicator that you're a dedicated member of Purdue Hackers. Passports should also establish a higher baseline level of trust within the org and unlock things accordingly—for example, entering Hack Night without having to ring the doorbell, or accessing managed hosting provided by Purdue Hackers by signing in with your passport.

# How it's going

- 50 passports have been made
- the first piece of infrastructure we made was `purduehackers/id`, the "sign in with passport" api. it's an oauth service with passports as a provider and it's really cool. we're currently building infra on top of it
- we also made a door opener, so people with passports can now open the locked doors to bechtel during hack night using their passport
- we make a new stamp every week (derived from the badge), and everyone with a passport gets stamped at hack night (include picture)
- currently having a passport is being an early adopter—no production apps use `id` yet—but people are already loving them
- by the end of the semester we'll ship `dash`, a dashboard that lets you do extra things but that you can only sign into with a passport. for example, changing the sound played to hack night when you scan your passport on the door opener

# How it started

We started exploring this idea at the beginning of the Fall 2023 semester. We initially explored alternatives such as plastic or metal ID cards, but quickly realized that passports felt _right_—we could make the unit costs comparable to or lower than ID cards, hackers would have to make them by hand (which would make them feel more special), and it's not a form of ID most people would expect (compared to plastic cards, which everyone has for government and school IDs).

Getting started was tough—none of us had any idea where to begin. Thankfully, the [Knowledge Lab](https://www.lib.purdue.edu/KnowledgeLab) stepped in to help. They're a new library makerspace on campus with a bunch of resources perfect for rapidly prototyping passports: Cricut machines, heat presses, sewing machines, printer with specialty paper, and lots more. Robin and Nathan, who help run the Knowledge Lab, are some of the kindest people we've ever met, and they helped us at every step, teaching us how to use the machines and bouncing ideas off us. This project would not have gotten off the ground had it not been for the resources in the Knowledge Lab & the kindness of those who run it.

We started in earnest in September, first experimenting with various designs in Figma:

<figcaption className="mt-2">Some early Figma designs. <span><a

      }}

</figure>

We then experimented with printing these designs on the Knowledge Lab's Riso printer, which prints in CMYK one color at a time, dozens of pages at a time. It's typically used for creating prints [like this.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/55/Barack_Obama_Hope_poster.jpg) We were hoping this approach would create a natural dithering effect and a color palette resembling real-world passports.

A Riso printer is purposefully imprecise, and each page is slightly different. Unfortunately, we realized that our designs needed sub-millimeter precision to render small bits of text and create neat bounds for cutting the pages to the right size, so the Riso printer wouldn't work for us. We ended up using a laser printer on regular printer paper—which sounds like it wouldn't feel right, but we actually discovered that when placed in the context of the rest of a passport, it creates an illusion that it's specialized "passport paper". Human brains are fascinating.

Efforts significantly ramped up in early November, when we made our first prototype.

The "Swiss version":

Then many more:

Nearly 20 prototypes later, we made our final prototype in January, and we were ready to mass-produce. We made [a website for people to create their data pages](https://github.com/purduehackers/passport-data-pages) and finalized the data & stamp page designs. Finally, we were ready to run our first passport-making ceremony, with 5 trusted beta testers, on January 26th:

</div>

The passport-making ceremonies have already achieved impressive scale. Prep work for the first two took an entire day, the ceremonies went significantly overtime, we lacked some necessary tools, and the results were notably low-quality; only two months later, 10 new people with no context or training make consistently high-quality passports in one hour every two weeks. The beginning of our own mini-industrial operation.

---

- we think passports are the next frontier of purdue hackers and we're really excited they're here
- this kind of stuff is uniquely enabled by us being a college club
- we're excited for `id` and `dash` and we're also really excited to see the infrastructure people build around passports in the future
