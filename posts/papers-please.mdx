ogDescription: Introducing the Purdue Hackers passports.

We spent 3 months designing & prototyping a passport for Purdue Hackers. Today, we want to share it with you.

The Purdue Hackers passport is a physical, passport-shaped booklet, containing a "data page" with information given by a user, and 16 pages for stamps.

Passports are handmade by their creators at hour-long passport-making ceremonies, which run every two weeks at Hack Night. Hackers sign up for a passport-making ceremony by [creating their personalized data page](https://passports.purduehackers.com).

Every week we laser cut a new stamp, and hackers get their passports stamped at Hack Night.

Every passport has an NFC sticker embedded in its cover, which has an ID written to it. This NFC sticker is the heart of a passport: it allows it to become a legitimate identifying document within our universe, and unique infrastructure to be built around it.

Passports have two goals:

### 1. Give hackers a physical keepsake from their time in college

We believe this is a uniquely special period of our lives, and we strongly believe in creating long-lasting, detailed documentation of it. The [Hack Night badges](https://arc.net/l/quote/vnenuxsq) are one way we do this, and we want passports to be another way. We want hackers to keep their passports with them forever, their data pages and stamps serving as vivid reminders of their time in Purdue Hackers.

### 2. Allow hackers to become "card-carrying members" of Purdue Hackers

We want passports to level you up as a member of Purdue Hackers. Having a passport signals that you are willing to spend an hour handcrafting it, and once you have one you can show it to others as a badge of honor—a physical indicator that you're a dedicated member of Purdue Hackers. Passports should also establish a higher baseline level of trust within the org and unlock things accordingly—for example, entering Hack Night without having to ring the doorbell, or accessing managed hosting provided by Purdue Hackers by signing in with your passport.

# How it started

- we had this idea in may 2023 and started exploring it in august 2023.
- we briefly explored plastic ID cards, but decided against them because we wanted something unique/subversive/unexpected/etc
- we got to work in september, first experimenting with a riso printer, which prints one color at a time in CMYK, which we hoped would create a nice dithered effect that has a passport feel. unfortunately that didn't work well—printing on a riso printer takes forever, and riso prints are not perfectly aligned by default, but we needed exact dimensions. so we scrapped it
- efforts significantly ramped up in early november when we made our first actual passport prototype! (include picture)
- we made 10(? verify number) passports by winter break. (include pictures)
- by january we had made our final prototype, and we were ready to mass-produce. we made the data page website and the first ceremony ran on january 20something

# How they're made

- layer of black picheng faux-leather (link to amazon). 17.8x12.4cm
- cover design is cut out of gold heat transfer vinyl from joann with a cricut maker 3, then heat pressed onto the faux leather
- two sets of laminated black cardstock 8.2x12.4cm, one on each side
- 1 layer of black cardstock, 17.4x12.4cm
- the pages are printed on regular printer paper, except for the first page which printed on cardstock
- we lay book tape (link to amaazon) on the data page. this, in addition to being printed on cardstock, gives it extra weight and important/official feel
- the pages are folded and sewed to the layer of black cardstock
- an nfc sticker is placed on one of the laminated cardstock pieces
- we glue everything with book glue (link to demco): laminated cardstock to faux leather, then sewed pages on top
- then the booklets are pressed open under a weight while the glue dries (24 hours ideally)
- nfc stickers are activated with the passport authority app we made (link to github)

# How it's going

- 50 passports have been made
- the first piece of infrastructure we made was `purduehackers/id`, the "sign in with passport" api. it's an oauth service with passports as a provider and it's really cool. we're currently building infra on top of it
- we also made a door opener, so people with passports can now open the locked doors to bechtel during hack night using their passport
- we make a new stamp every week (derived from the badge), and everyone with a passport gets stamped at hack night (include picture)
- currently having a passport is being an early adopter—no production apps use `id` yet—but people are already loving them
- by the end of the semester we'll ship `dash`, a dashboard that lets you do extra things but that you can only sign into with a passport. for example, changing the sound played to hack night when you scan your passport on the door opener

---

- we think passports are the next frontier of purdue hackers and we're really excited they're here
- this kind of stuff is uniquely enabled by us being a college club
- we're excited for `id` and `dash` and we're also really excited to see the infrastructure people build around passports in the future
