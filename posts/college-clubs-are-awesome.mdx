ogDescription: A reflection on Purdue Hackers & the college club format
---

The first major project I ever worked on, and what first got me into coding, was a Minecraft server called [Extrillius](https://extrillius.wordpress.com), which I built in middle school. I wanted to create a minigame server whose 1) player experience was endlessly customizable and 2) games were built by & for the community. I sketched out an idea that allowed players to build a parkour map in the Creative server and "export" it to the Parkour server. One of my ideas—"parties" where small groups of people can filter players and chat to them & play games together—was later implemented by [Hypixel](https://hypixel.net/#:~:text=16%20minutes%20ago-,About%20Us,-Starting%20out%20as). [My first GitHub repository](https://github.com/MatthewStanciu/SwearToggle) is the first plugin I wrote for Extrillius: a swear filter toggleable per person.

What I really wanted to build was _a community_ where people made friends, built things together, and felt a shared sense of ownership over the community; Minecraft was just the platform on which I was building it.

But Minecraft servers are boring: probably 90% of all Minecraft servers in history were started by a middle schooler who taped together popular plugins and paid $50 to advertise on Minecraft Server List before shutting it down after a month. Starting a Minecraft server is easy, and Minecraft is a game, so there's a low ceiling to how impressive it is to start one.

College clubs are also boring: partly insulated from the real world and run by volunteers who necessarily work on it part-time, most people who participate in one do so out of social pressure or, more often, to put a line item on their resumés. College clubs can provide memorable experiences, but they're often not life-changing to members, and for many the perceived value of the resumé line item far exceeds the value of actually being there.

I wanted Extrillius to take the form of a Minecraft server despite their perceived shortcomings because I felt like there were hidden gems in the format that could make them better for everyone. All the servers I visited—even the more legitimate ones, like Hypixel—felt rigid and untrusting: the game modes, maps, chat structure, rules, and ranks were all created by the server owners, and players had no control over them. Moreover, the culture was such that moderators and admins were gods who enforced rules as they wished, didn't appreciate feedback, and viewed players as malicious by default. I found this all quite strange for a game whose core tenets were exploration, creativity, and collaboration. The APIs that allowed their and every other popular server to exist—[Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/) and [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/)—are open-source projects created by & for the community. Why couldn't a Minecraft server allow players to create their own game maps, or control what they see in their chat, or control who they see & play with, or add functionality to the game? Why couldn't a Minecraft server be a medium-trust environment instead of a low-trust one? Why couldn't a Minecraft server be a community?

On September 16th, 2022, Purdue Hackers began an experiment called Hack Night: every Friday night, a group of people gather and make projects together. Hack Night made two bets:

1. People don't make things because it's hard and their classes drain their energy—but if they were given a period of uninterrupted time to make things with other people, they would make unimaginably creative things.
2. Many people don't actually have something to do on Friday night and are looking for a group of friendly and interesting people to hang out with every week.

This was not an obvious bet: some pushed back, fearing nobody would come to an event on Friday night. But at [the third event](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-03), something strange happened: a few hours in, a group of people spontaneously gathered together and created a new way to measure time.

    className="w-full aspect-video rounded-lg"
  ></iframe>
</div>

It's called [Lightning Time](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time), and its creation was incredibly eye-opening for me. For one, it validated Hack Night's first bet—something I thought would take much longer. But even more surprising was the month after Lightning Time was created: we created a [Raycast extension](https://www.raycast.com/MatthewStanciu/lightning-time), [an npm package](https://github.com/purduehackers/time) which we later used on [the Hack Night dashboard](https://github.com/purduehackers/night), and [an explainer](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time) with custom, interactive React components—the post for which this blog was initially created.

We created a new thing for people to use, built tooling, wrote documentation, marketed it, and shipped it. We basically shipped a product. Sure, the product is useful to almost no one and we have $0 in MRR—but we shipped a product! It was exhilarating.

Barely a month later, we did it again when we shipped [a new landing page](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/2022-homepage)—a marvel of creativity and attention to detail that continues to make me smile every time I visit it four months later.

We shipped [a Macroquad code editor](https://github.com/purduehackers/rust-mq-playground). We shipped [a website for viewing upcoming & past events](https://github.com/purduehackers/events). We shipped [a public API](https://github.com/purduehackers/api). We shipped [an Edge Config-based link shortener with an optimistic UI dashboard](https://github.com/purduehackers/puhack.horse). We've been shipping! And all of it is real software intended to be used by real people.

One lens through which you can view this is that Purdue Hackers operates somewhat like a startup: we run three core programs, and we build software to support our core programs, all of which are intended for real users. But unlike a startup, we're not trying to make money. All our software can suck: we can have show-stopping errors, downtime, terrible performance. We can build and rebuild all our software, entirely open-source. We can experiment with new & unstable technologies. Churn doesn't matter because thousands of new potential "customers" come in every Fall. Most of our operating costs come in the form of food for events and don't total more than a couple hundred dollars per month. Companies like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=purdue-hackers&utm_campaign=oss) are happy to sponsor our web hosting costs. And other companies are knocking on our door to sponsor us, because all of this creates people with real engineering skills and product sense who they want to get in front of.

Many of our new software projects have been spearheaded by organizers, but Hack Night has become a model for what open-source collaboration looks like. Today, 30 people gather at Purdue's makerspace to make projects together every week—including generative art, an RC car, a website that lets you draw by holding your finger up to your webcam, and a NeoPixel Lightning Time clock.

This is the hidden gem of the college club format. CS-adjacent college clubs can operate similarly to a startup, shipping real software for real users in a high-energy environment—but they don't have to face any of the real-world constraints that startups face, such as significant operating costs, delivering business value, being cash flow-positive, and ensuring their products are high-quality. Instead, they can channel the high-energy environment of startups toward creating & contributing to open-source projects, making art, and learning new technologies.

Unbounded by real-world constraints and energized by those around them, college club members can quickly build portfolios of impressive and creatively fulfilling projects. [something about it being both personally fulfilling and making them more employable]

This arrangement is uniquely enabled by the environment of a university. I struggle to think of another space in the world where something like what I described is possible. The closest thing to it that I can think of is the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)—but the Recurse Center's retreat only lasts 6-12 weeks, whereas a college club lasts up to 4 years; and attending the Recurse Center comes at a cost to attendees in the form of taking time off work and (for their in-person retreat) living in New York City, whereas college clubs simply support the goals that students are already pursuing by being in college.

Purdue Hackers has become a great demonstration of the success of this model over the 2022-2023 school year. One year ago today, we had no community and no culture of shipping; today, we've shipped everything I mentioned earlier and community members are working on a [Purdue Hackers flag](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/905833672849113113/1103052038193033306/Screenshot_2023-05-02_at_4.14.36_PM.png?width=1474&height=936), [a two-foot-tall LED-lit Conway glider](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/905833672849113113/1103052037899436092/Screenshot_2023-05-02_at_4.14.05_PM.png?width=1430&height=936) powered by [a custom PCB](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/905833672849113113/1103052037664559194/Screenshot_2023-05-02_at_4.13.56_PM.png?width=880&height=936), [an experiment in program synthesis](https://mkhan45.github.io/learning_synthesis/), [Conway's Game of Life over SSH](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/905833672849113113/1103052694693871657/Screenshot_2023-05-02_at_4.17.26_PM.png?width=1322&height=936), an electronic drum kit, and many more incredible projects.

A strong community identity has also emerged. Projects like the LED Conway glider are built by & for community members; the SSH Game of Life app was initially built for [a workshop](https://events.purduehackers.com/go-game-of-life-workshop) run by a community member. Multiple community members have told me that Purdue Hackers has become their primary friend group. All this would have been unfathomable a year ago, before we unlocked the hidden gems of college clubs.
