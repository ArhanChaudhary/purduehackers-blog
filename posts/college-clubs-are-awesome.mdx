ogDescription: A reflection on Purdue Hackers & the college club format

The first major project I ever worked on, and what first got me into coding, was a Minecraft server called [Extrillius](https://extrillius.wordpress.com), which I built in middle school. I wanted to create a minigame server whose 1) player experience was endlessly customizable and 2) games were built by & for the community. I sketched out an idea that allowed players to build a parkour map in the Creative server and "export" it to the Parkour server. One of my ideas—"parties" of up to 4 where chat is filtered to your party and you join games together—was later implemented by Hypixel. [My first GitHub repository](https://github.com/MatthewStanciu/SwearToggle) is the first plugin I wrote for Extrillius.

What I really wanted to build was _a community_ where people made lifelong friends, built things together, and felt a shared sense of ownership over the community; Minecraft was just the platform on which I was building it.

After two years, I stopped working on Extrillius for two reasons:

1. I didn't know anyone who knew how to code and couldn't convince my friends to start.
2. I felt like I would sink years of my time into it only for outside observers to not "get" it—"Oh that's cute, I had a little Minecraft server too!"

That second reason is really interesting to me, because I've now been running [Purdue Hackers](https://purduehackers.com) for a year and have started to notice parallels to Extrillius.

Minecraft servers are boring: probably 90% of all Minecraft servers in history were started by a middle schooler who taped together plugins for a few popular minigames, paid $50 to advertise on Minecraft Server List, and copy/pasted ranks from other servers onto a Buycraft store in order to make money on the side, before shutting it down after a few months. Anyone could start "a little Minecraft server", and Minecraft is game, so there's a low ceiling to how impressive you are to others if you start one.

College clubs are also boring: partly insulated from the real world and run by volunteers who necessarily work on it part-time, most people who participate in one do so out of social pressure or, more often, to put a line item on their resume. College clubs for sure can provide memorable experiences, but they're often not life-changing to members, and for many the value of the resume line item far exceeds the value of actually being there.
