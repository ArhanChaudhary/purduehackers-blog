ogDescription: A reflection on Purdue Hackers & the college club format
---

The first major project I ever worked on, and what first got me into coding, was a Minecraft server called [Extrillius](https://extrillius.wordpress.com), which I built in middle school. I wanted to create a minigame server whose 1) player experience was endlessly customizable and 2) games were built by & for the community. I sketched out an idea that allowed players to build a parkour map in the Creative server and "export" it to the Parkour server. One of my ideas—"parties" of up to 4 where chat is filtered to your party and you join games together—was later implemented by Hypixel. [My first GitHub repository](https://github.com/MatthewStanciu/SwearToggle) is the first plugin I wrote for Extrillius: a swear filter toggleable per person.

What I really wanted to build was _a community_ where people made friends, built things together, and felt a shared sense of ownership over the community; Minecraft was just the platform on which I was building it.

After two years, I stopped working on Extrillius for two reasons:

1. I didn't know anyone who knew how to code and couldn't convince my friends to start.
2. I felt like I would sink years of my time into it only for outside observers to not "get" it—"Oh that's cute, I had a little Minecraft server too!"

That second reason is really interesting to me, because I've now been running [Purdue Hackers](https://purduehackers.com) for a year and have started to notice parallels to Extrillius.

Minecraft servers are boring: probably 90% of all Minecraft servers in history were started by a middle schooler who taped together plugins for a few popular minigames, paid $50 to advertise on Minecraft Server List, and copy/pasted ranks from other servers onto a Buycraft store in order to make money on the side, before shutting it down after a few months. Anyone could start "a little Minecraft server", and Minecraft is a game, so there's a low ceiling to how impressive it is to start one.

College clubs are also boring: partly insulated from the real world and run by volunteers who necessarily work on it part-time, most people who participate in one do so out of social pressure or, more often, to put a line item on their resumé. College clubs for sure can provide memorable experiences, but they're often not life-changing to members, and for many the value of the resumé line item far exceeds the value of actually being there.

I wanted Extrillius to take the form of a Minecraft server despite their perceived shortcomings because I felt like there were hidden gems in the format that could make them leagues better for everyone. All the servers I visited—even the more legitimate ones—felt rigid and untrusting: the game modes, maps, chat structure, rules, and ranks were all created by the server owners, and players had no control over them. Moreover, the culture was such that moderators and admins were gods who enforced rules as they wished, didn't appreciate feedback, and viewed players as malicious by default. I found this all quite strange for a game whose core tenets were exploration, creativity, and collaboration. The APIs that allowed their and every other popular server to exist, for example—[Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/) and [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/)—are open-source projects created by & for the community. Why couldn't you have a server that allows players to create their own game maps, or control what they see in their chat, or control who they see & play with, or add functionality to the games? Why couldn't a Minecraft server be a medium-trust environment instead of a low-trust one? Why couldn't a Minecraft server be a community?

I get the impression that college CS clubs, based on the few I've observed, are largely guided by the following principles:

1. A computer science degree alone is no longer sufficient for getting a good job; these days, employers also want to see strong extracurriculars.
2. A good way to stand out to employers is to have marketable skills.
3. Learning to ace a coding interview is hugely important for your career.

Notice how all three of these principles optimize for looking good to employers. I find this a deeply strange thing to optimize for, for a couple reasons:

1. It approaches tech employment with the same mindset as applying to college as a high schooler: get good grades in school and put impressive-sounding positions & awards on your resumé. I think this is the wrong approach because tech companies often care way more about your skills over your grades & positions—they're not universities!—and it encourages playing the same game as everyone else, which makes it much harder to stand out.
2. It makes the community worse. If people come to your club mostly because they think it'll help their career, you'll end up with people who are looking to check boxes and don't actually _want_ to be there, which feels sad. The Purdue Hackers events that appealed to career-optimizing were consistently our worst events for this reason.
3. If you're building it for everyone, you're building it for no one. Every computer science major is worried about passing coding interviews and finding a high-paying job, so for sure you'll get numbers by appealing to these worries—but I think it's a pretty lowest-common-denominator, unimaginative way to think about who you're building for. Surely there are better, more positive things you can appeal to than CS majors' box-checking nightmares!
4. Most importantly: it's bullshit! Shouldn't we be optimizing for _being_ good instead of _looking_ good? Looking good without being good encourages people to take shortcuts, cheat, lie, exaggerate, and sell a false version of themselves instead of doing real things. If we instead optimize for being good, we can still check all the boxes, but we'll be even more desirable because we'll actually _be_ good! It's like people who go to extreme lengths to cheat on an exam: wouldn't your time be better spent actually learning the material?

I can't help but be reminded of the Minecraft servers I played on in middle school when I see clubs like this. I think the college club format, like a Minecraft server, is a vastly underrated medium with an endless number of hidden gems which, with a little imagination and a lot of love, can be used to make them a million times better for everyone involved.
