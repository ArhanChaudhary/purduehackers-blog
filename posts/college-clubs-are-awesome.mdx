ogDescription: A reflection on Purdue Hackers & the college club format
---

The first major project I ever worked on, and what first got me into coding, was a Minecraft server called [Extrillius](https://extrillius.wordpress.com), which I built in middle school. I wanted to create a minigame server whose 1) player experience was endlessly customizable and 2) games were built by & for the community. I sketched out an idea that allowed players to build a parkour map in the Creative server and "export" it to the Parkour server. One of my ideas—"parties" where small groups of people can filter players and chat to them & play games together—was later implemented by [Hypixel](https://hypixel.net/#:~:text=16%20minutes%20ago-,About%20Us,-Starting%20out%20as). [My first GitHub repository](https://github.com/MatthewStanciu/SwearToggle) is the first plugin I wrote for Extrillius: a swear filter toggleable per person.

What I really wanted to build was _a community_ where people made friends, built things together, and felt a shared sense of ownership over the community; Minecraft was just the platform on which I was building it.

But Minecraft servers are boring: probably 90% of all Minecraft servers in history were started by a middle schooler who taped together popular plugins and paid $50 to advertise on Minecraft Server List before shutting it down after a month. Starting a Minecraft server is easy, and Minecraft is a game, so there's a low ceiling to how impressive it is to start one.

College clubs are also boring: partly insulated from the real world and run by volunteers who necessarily work on it part-time, most people who participate in one do so out of social pressure or, more often, to put a line item on their resumés. College clubs can provide memorable experiences, but they're often not life-changing to members, and for many the perceived value of the resumé line item far exceeds the value of actually being there.

I wanted Extrillius to take the form of a Minecraft server despite their perceived shortcomings because I felt like there were hidden gems in the format that could make them leagues better for everyone. All the servers I visited—even the more legitimate ones, like Hypixel—felt rigid and untrusting: the game modes, maps, chat structure, rules, and ranks were all created by the server owners, and players had no control over them. Moreover, the culture was such that moderators and admins were gods who enforced rules as they wished, didn't appreciate feedback, and viewed players as malicious by default. I found this all quite strange for a game whose core tenets were exploration, creativity, and collaboration. The APIs that allowed their and every other popular server to exist—[Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/) and [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/)—are open-source projects created by & for the community. Why couldn't a Minecraft server allow players to create their own game maps, or control what they see in their chat, or control who they see & play with, or add functionality to the game? Why couldn't a Minecraft server be a medium-trust environment instead of a low-trust one? Why couldn't a Minecraft server be a community?

I get the impression that college CS clubs, based on the few I've observed, are largely guided by the following principles:

1. A computer science degree alone is no longer sufficient for getting a good job; these days, employers also want to see strong extracurriculars.
2. A good way to stand out to employers is to have marketable skills.
3. Learning to ace a coding interview is hugely important for your career.

Notice how all three of these principles optimize for looking good to employers. I think this is a terrible thing to optimize for, for a couple reasons:

1. It approaches tech employment with the same mindset as applying to college as a high schooler: get good grades in school and put impressive-sounding positions & awards on your resumé. I think this is the wrong approach because tech companies often care way more about your skills over your grades & positions—they're not universities!—and it encourages playing the same game as everyone else, which makes it much harder to stand out.
2. It makes the community worse. If people come to your club mostly because they think it'll help their careers, you'll end up with people who are looking to check boxes and don't actually _want_ to be there, which makes the atmosphere feel sad and soulless. The Purdue Hackers events that appealed to career-optimizing were consistently our worst events for this reason.
3. If you're building for everyone, you're building for no one. Everyone who wants to work in tech is worried about passing technical interviews and landing a job; appealing to these worries will get you numbers, but I think it's an unimaginative and lowest-common-denominator thing to build for, and difficult to form a strong identity around. Many universities offer free resumé reviews and career resources; instead of serving a market that's already being served, why not find ways in which people aren't currently being served?
4. It assumes that technical work can only be done by CS majors, and/or only CS people are interested in the first place—but in reality, one's major is a weak indicator of how technical they are. Many of the most impressive projects in Purdue Hackers's community were made by non-CS majors.
5. It encourages achieving your goals by _looking_ good, which feels totally backwards to me. Shouldn't we be optimizing for _being_ good instead of _looking_ good? Looking good encourages people to take shortcuts, cheat, lie, exaggerate, and sell a false version of themselves. If we instead optimize for being good—for example, building real things and learning real marketable skills—we can still check all the boxes, but we'll be even more desirable because we'll actually _be_ good! It's like people who go to extreme lengths to cheat on an exam: wouldn't your time be better spent actually learning the material?

I can't help but be reminded of the Minecraft servers I played on in middle school: I think many college CS clubs are optimizing for the wrong things—but despite this, I think the college club format, like a Minecraft server, contains an endless number of hidden gems which can make them uniquely amazing if used.

On September 16th, 2022, Purdue Hackers began an experiment called Hack Night: every Friday night, a group of people gather and make projects together. Hack Night made two bets:

1. People don't make things because it's hard and their classes drain their energy—but if they were given a period of uninterrupted time to make things with others who shared the same goal, they would start creating unimaginably creative things.
2. Many people don't actually have something to do on Friday night and are looking for a group of friendly and interesting people to hang out with every week.

This was not an obvious bet: some pushed back, fearing nobody would come on Friday night. But at [the third event](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-03), something strange happened: a few hours in, a group of people spontaneously gathered together and created a new way to measure time.

<div className="w-full sm:w-1/2 sm:mx-auto">
  <iframe
    src="https://lightning-time.vercel.app"
    className="w-full aspect-video rounded-lg"
  ></iframe>
</div>

It's called [Lightning Time](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time), and its creation was incredibly eye-opening for me. For one, it validated Hack Night's first bet—something I thought would take much longer. But even more surprising was the month after which Lightning Time was created: we created a [Raycast extension](https://www.raycast.com/MatthewStanciu/lightning-time), [an npm package](https://github.com/purduehackers/time) which we later used on [the Hack Night dashboard](https://github.com/purduehackers/night), and [an explainer](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time) with custom, interactive React components—the post for which this blog was initially created.

We created a new thing for people to use, built tooling, wrote documentation, marketed it, and shipped it. It was exhilarating: we basically shipped a product. Sure, the product is useful to almost no one and we have $0 in MRR—but we shipped a product!

Barely a month later, we did it again when we shipped [a new landing page](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/2022-homepage)—a marvel of creativity and attention to detail that continues to make me smile every time I visit it four months later.

We shipped [a Macroquad code editor](https://github.com/purduehackers/rust-mq-playground). We shipped [a website for viewing upcoming & past events](https://github.com/purduehackers/events). We shipped [a public API](https://github.com/purduehackers/api). We shipped [an Edge Config-based link shortener with an optimistic UI dashboard](https://github.com/purduehackers/puhack.horse). We've been shipping! And all of it is real software intended to be used by real people.

One lens through which you can view this is that Purdue Hackers operates somewhat like a startup: we run three core programs, and we build software to support our core programs, all of which are intended for real users. But unlike a startup, we're not trying to make money. We don't need to pay employees because there are no employees. Most of our operating costs are in the form of food for events and don't total more than a couple hundred dollars per month. Companies like Vercel are happy to sponsor all our software that costs money. And we have companies knocking on our door to sponsor us, because all of this creates people with real engineering skills and product sense who they want to get in front of.

Meanwhile, Hack Night is flourishing. 30 people come reliably to Purdue's makerspace to make projects together. [We laser cut badges](https://twitter.com/purduehackers/status/1641567349626003457?s=20) out of a different style of acrylic, with a different design, every week to give out as collectibles. Hack Night projects include generative art, an RC car, a website that lets you draw by holding your finger up to your webcam, and a NeoPixel Lightning Time clock.
