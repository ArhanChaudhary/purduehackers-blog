ogDescription: A reflection on Purdue Hackers & the college club format
---

The first major project I ever worked on, and what first got me into coding, was a Minecraft server called [Extrillius](https://extrillius.wordpress.com), which I built in middle school. I wanted to create a minigame server whose 1) player experience was endlessly customizable and 2) games were built by & for the community. I sketched out an idea that allowed players to build a parkour map in the Creative server and "export" it to the Parkour server. One of my ideas—"parties" of up to 4 where chat is filtered to your party and you join games together—was later implemented by Hypixel. [My first GitHub repository](https://github.com/MatthewStanciu/SwearToggle) is the first plugin I wrote for Extrillius.

What I really wanted to build was _a community_ where people made lifelong friends, built things together, and felt a shared sense of ownership over the community; Minecraft was just the platform on which I was building it.

After two years, I stopped working on Extrillius for two reasons:

1. I didn't know anyone who knew how to code and couldn't convince my friends to start.
2. I felt like I would sink years of my time into it only for outside observers to not "get" it—"Oh that's cute, I had a little Minecraft server too!"

That second reason is really interesting to me, because I've now been running [Purdue Hackers](https://purduehackers.com) for a year and have started to notice parallels to Extrillius.

Minecraft servers are boring: probably 90% of all Minecraft servers in history were started by a middle schooler who taped together plugins for a few popular minigames, paid $50 to advertise on Minecraft Server List, and copy/pasted ranks from other servers onto a Buycraft store in order to make money on the side, before shutting it down after a few months. Anyone could start "a little Minecraft server", and Minecraft is a game, so there's a low ceiling to how impressive it is to start one.

College clubs are also boring: partly insulated from the real world and run by volunteers who necessarily work on it part-time, most people who participate in one do so out of social pressure or, more often, to put a line item on their resume. College clubs for sure can provide memorable experiences, but they're often not life-changing to members, and for many the value of the resume line item far exceeds the value of actually being there.

I wanted Extrillius to take the form of a Minecraft server despite their perceived shortcomings because I felt like there were hidden gems in the format that could make them leagues better for everyone. All the servers I visited—even the more legitimate ones—felt rigid and untrusting: the game modes, maps, chat structure, rules, and ranks were all created by the server owners, and players had no control over any of them. Moreover, the culture was such that moderators and admins were gods who enforced rules as they wished, didn't appreciate feedback, and viewed players as malicious by default. I found this all quite strange for a game whose core tenets were exploration, creativity, and collaboration. The APIs that allowed their and every other popular server to exist, for example—[Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/) and [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/)—are open-source projects created by & for the community. Why couldn't you have a server that allows players to create their own game maps, or control what they see in their chat, or control who they see & play with, or add functionality to the games? Why couldn't a Minecraft server be a medium-trust environment instead of a low-trust one? Why couldn't a Minecraft server be a community?

I want to make the case that the college club format, like a Minecraft server, is a vastly underrated medium—and if more people took advantage of their hidden gems, they would be leagues better for everyone.
