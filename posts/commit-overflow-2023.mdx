ogDescription: ðŸŸ© We challenged our community to make things over winter break.

In December of 2022, we started Commit Overflow - a project where we would get our community to make new things to head into the new year. During the winter break, members of the Purdue Hackers community would strive to learn, commit, or do something every day. This year, we upped the ante: if they committed for 10 days straight, they would earn a badge like they did last year. However, if they committed for the last 10 days of 2023 AND the first 6 days of the new year, they would earn [insert whatever matthew's solution was].

This year, 34 people reacted to our announcement, and 30 of them showed off their cool projects.

Like last year, the freedom to explore anything led some to stick solely to one project, while others bounced around different topics. Some of the exciting projects included a React app to show a to-do list (JavaScript), a Nintendo DS emulator (C), and a new Minecraft mod (Java). Of course, many others just decided to do smaller tasks, such as Leetcode, Advent of Code, or simply learn a new language (such as Rust) at their own pace.
One of the big improvements of Commit Overflow this year was that instead of having everyone post their updates in a single channel, we would use Discord's forums to have each participant create and post in their own thread. This was awesome was that each person had their own place to post their updates, and both during and after Commit Overflow, I enjoyed just scrolling through each person's thread and seeing the evolution of projects day by day. It was a unique insight into project development that you don't get to see by just looking at a GitHub repository, if at all.

In total, 4 people pushed for 10 consecutive days, and 2 more people pushed for all 16 days of Commit Overflow. We challenged our community to make this year as great as last year, and they met the challenge head-on. It was incredible to see our community posting something new every day, as they pushed themselves to finish that feature, fix that bug, or explore that cool new thing and show off the fruits of their labor.
