ogDescription: üü© We challenged our community to make things for 10 days over winter break.

Making things as a college student is hard when you're pulled in every direction by academic and social obligations. Breaks are a great time to do it‚Äîbut getting started can be difficult.

Shortly after Purdue's winter break began, we proposed a challenge for the Purdue Hackers community: for the last 10 days of 2022, push to GitHub at least once every day and share an update in the <span className="px-1 bg-discord-vibrant text-white rounded font-main">#‚õµÔ∏èsail</span> channel in our Discord. If they made it all 10 days, we'd give them stickers and a custom laser-cut badge that will never be made or distributed again.

![Poster advertising Commit Overflow. A tree made out of 10 squares colored different shades of green with a star at the top. Below, "Commit Overflow", "Commit to GitHub and post an update in #sail every day.", "10 days, 12/21-12/31, 2022"](/posts/commit-overflow-2022/poster.png)

42 people reacted to our announcement; of those, 20 people shared at least one update.

Some people worked on a single project for all 10 days; others worked on a different project every day or couple days. Projects included a React app to help decide which Computer Science track to take, implementing different types of fractals, a program that simulates how electrons and protons interact in molecules, and an SSH app for reviewing movies.

Of the 20 people who shared at least one update, 9 shared an update every day.

We're proud of this turnout‚ÄîCommit Overflow was announced two days before it began, and it generated more excitement, energy, and consistent activity in the community than any event we ran this Fall. It's proof that a vibrant Purdue Hackers community is already here; we just need to cultivate it.
