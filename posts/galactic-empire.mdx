ogDescription: For the long-term future of Purdue Hackers.

I recently read Isaac Asimov’s _Foundation_ trilogy, and it got me thinking a lot about Purdue Hackers. Originally published as short stories throughout the 1940s, _Foundation_ is set in the far future, where humans have conquered the Milky Way and established a Galactic Empire. One scientist, Hari Seldon, develops a new form of science called “psychohistory”, which allows for mathematically predicting macro-level trends in human history.

One day, Hari Seldon predicts with near certainty that the Galactic Empire, which has stood strong for thousands of years, will soon collapse, and 30,000 years of dark ages will follow. It’s too late to stop the collapse—there’s too much inertia across the Galaxy—but it’s not too late to shorten the dark ages. So Hari Seldon establishes the Foundation, a group of 100,000 scientists at the edge of the Galaxy who are tasked with chronicling all of human history and knowledge in the _Encyclopedia Galactia_.

Meanwhile, Hari Seldon sets up every Foundation-and-adjacent human, like dominos, in such a way that the Foundation will emerge as a new and better Galactic Empire in only 1,000 years.

The remainder of the three _Foundation_ books is Hari Seldon’s vision playing out over many generations—how they conquer their neighborhood, then spread further out into the Galaxy, developing magical technology and encouraging art, science, and culture to flourish on their planets.

I’ve been leading Purdue Hackers for two years. In this time, Purdue Hackers has radically transformed: 80 people make things at Hack Night, our mini hackathon, every week; we have a vibrant & friendly online community of 2,000 hackers constantly shipping projects; every week, we design and laser cut [collectible “badges”](https://arc.net/l/quote/oltqquwc) for club members, and we’ve never missed a week; we’ve made esoteric projects like [Lightning Time](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time), and created rituals around them, like [the weekly count to 0](https://youtu.be/iOTNc4vM3T0?si=LbYxeohQi38htcqq); many community members have access to core channels and own major pieces of the org; we’ve received donations from tech leaders like Paul Graham and Steve Wozniak; we have a strong brand and regularly put out high-quality visual material.

I have one year left before I graduate in the spring of 2025, and one thing I’ve become acutely aware of is that none of this was inevitable. Purdue Hackers, in its 11-year history, has never looked like this before, and getting here required an unbelievable amount of effort and many stars to align. About a year ago, I personally decided that Purdue Hackers was what I wanted to do in college, and dropped everything outside of classes to pursue it essentially full time. Had I not done this, Purdue Hackers would look very different.

This concerns me for two reasons: almost none of what we think of as “modern-day Purdue Hackers” exists outside the minds of the current generation; and running a high-quality student org should not require its leader to drop everything to work on it full-time.

But as it stands today, when we graduate, none of our knowledge or values will stick around, and running Purdue Hackers _will_ require a full-time effort from its future leaders. These both must change over the next year—and I want to share how I plan on doing that.

# The Fire & the Tide

The Fire is the deep, burning desire to do things, with confidence, strong conviction, and excellent taste. It’s difficult to explain, but you “just know” know when someone’s “got” the Fire. Some people are born with it; others learn it. In both cases, it must be kindled, or it will flame out.

Many kids have the Fire at a very young age, but K12 education beats it out of them. College is a great place to (re-)kindle the Fire, but it doesn’t happen by default.

The Tide is the forces of your environment that push you in a particular direction. The Tide is the reason why you’re the sum of the people you spend most of your time around. 60% of the Tide is set by your birth country and socioeconomic background; the rest is set by a million things throughout your life, but most importantly your education and your friends.

It’s possible, but often very difficult, to fight against the Tide. Those who successfully do so are either inspiring success stories or tragedies. But the Tide *can* be changed relatively quickly with a change of environment, education, and/or friends.

The goal of Purdue Hackers over the last two years has been to establish a Tide that kindles the Fire. The community should naturally push you to make things and be radically kind and weird; Hack Night should naturally push you to make your closest friends and ship ambitious projects. And it should feel organic: people should feel pushed by an invisible hand, not forced or pressured.
