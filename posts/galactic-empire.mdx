ogDescription: For the long-term future of Purdue Hackers.
---

I recently read Isaac Asimov’s _Foundation_ trilogy, and it got me thinking a lot about Purdue Hackers. Originally published as short stories throughout the 1940s, _Foundation_ is set in the far future, where humans have conquered the Milky Way and established a Galactic Empire. One scientist, Hari Seldon, develops a new form of science called “psychohistory”, which allows for mathematically predicting macro-level trends in human history.

One day, Hari Seldon predicts with near certainty that the Galactic Empire, which has stood strong for thousands of years, will soon collapse, and 30,000 years of dark ages will follow. It’s too late to stop the collapse—there’s too much inertia across the Galaxy—but it’s not too late to shorten the dark ages. So Hari Seldon establishes the Foundation, a group of 100,000 scientists at the edge of the Galaxy who are tasked with chronicling all of human history and knowledge in the _Encyclopedia Galactica_.

Meanwhile, Hari Seldon sets up every Foundation-and-adjacent human, like dominos, in such a way that by the laws of psychohistory, the Foundation will emerge as a new and better Galactic Empire in only 1,000 years.

The remainder of the three _Foundation_ books is Hari Seldon’s Plan playing out over many generations—how they conquer their neighborhood, handle unpredictable variables that threaten the Plan, and spread further out into the Galaxy, developing magical technology and encouraging art, science, and culture to flourish on their planets.

I’ve been leading Purdue Hackers for two years. In this time, Purdue Hackers has radically transformed: 80 people make things at Hack Night, our weekly hacker festival; we have a vibrant & friendly online community of 2,000 hackers constantly shipping projects; every week, we design and laser cut [collectible “badges”](https://arc.net/l/quote/oltqquwc) for club members, and we’ve never missed a week; we’ve made esoteric projects like [Lightning Time](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time), and created rituals around them, like [the weekly count to 0](https://youtu.be/iOTNc4vM3T0?si=LbYxeohQi38htcqq); we’ve received donations from tech leaders like Paul Graham and Steve Wozniak.

I have one year before I graduate in the spring of 2025, and something I’ve become acutely aware of is that none of this was inevitable. Purdue Hackers, in its 11-year history, has never looked like this before, and getting here required an unbelievable amount of effort and many stars to align. About a year ago, I personally decided that Purdue Hackers was what I wanted to do in college, and dropped everything outside of classes to pursue it essentially full time. Had I not done this, Purdue Hackers would look very different.

I am so glad I chose to deeply invest in this org, and am extremely proud of its rapid transformation and acceleration over the last two years. But I am also concerned for its future: running a high-quality student org should not require its leader to drop everything to work on it full time, and we shouldn’t expect any future leader to do so. More importantly, none of what Purdue Hackers is today exists outside the minds of the current generation: if we were to graduate today, Purdue Hackers would immediately cease to exist. If Purdue Hackers is to survive the next 11 years and beyond, both of these things must change. I want to share how I plan on achieving this–and, in doing so, carve a path that other club leaders can follow too.

# The Fire & the Current

The Fire is the deep, burning desire to do things, with confidence, strong conviction, and boundless curiosity. It’s difficult to explain, but you “just know” know when someone’s “got” the Fire. Some people are born with it; others learn it. In both cases, it must be kindled, or it will flame out.

Many kids have the Fire at a very young age, but K12 education beats it out of them. College is a great place to (re-)kindle the Fire, but it doesn’t happen by default.

The Current is the forces of your environment that push you in a particular direction. The Current is the reason why you’re the sum of the people you spend the most time around. 60% of the Current is set by your birth country and socioeconomic background; the rest is set by a million things throughout your life, but most importantly your education and your friends.

It’s possible, but often very difficult, to fight against the Current. Those who successfully do so are either inspiring success stories or tragedies. But the Current *can* be changed relatively quickly with a change of environment, education, and/or friends.

The goal of Purdue Hackers over the last two years has been to establish a Current that kindles the Fire. The community should naturally push you to make things and be radically kind and weird; Hack Night should naturally push you to make your closest friends and ship ambitious projects, constantly surprising yourself. And it should feel organic: the Current should make it the default state for people, not force or pressure them.

# Ideal state of matter

Hacker culture in universities began in 2013 with the founding of collegiate hackathons across North America, like MHacks, CalHacks, BoilerMake, HackIllinois, and HackGT. Almost all of these hackathons started across North America at roughly the same time, like a Big Bang. Purdue Hackers spawned directly out of this Big Bang in September 2013: at the time, the Purdue Hackers and BoilerMake folks were all the same friend group.

The first few years of collegiate hackathons are full of incredible legends. Renegade hackers were starting a movement, running thousand-person events and raising money from Apple and Twilio, who were hiring people straight out of the hackathons. The creators of [an iOS app called Workflow](https://youtu.be/fSh6Q0F4d9Q?si=upoNalyyBgbUbDIe), the grand prize at MHacks III, were hired by Apple to turn it into [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios). Stories like this led to the rallying cry, [“College hackathons are the new career fair.”](https://medium.com/@hellyeah/dear-corporations-please-stop-throwing-your-own-hackathons-21a692021b65#:~:text=In%20terms%20of%20recruiting%2C%20college,are%20the%20new%20career%20fair.) People would travel to a different hackathon in a different part of the country every week on free buses sent by the hackathons.

Ten years later, the landscape looks very different. Most of the big players in tech no longer sponsor hackathons, and most hackathons have established deep relationships with regional companies, who regularly sponsor them every year. Many university CS departments also now set aside budget every year for their hackathons. At the time of the Big Bang, collegiate hackathons were a new idea proposed by renegades who were forging a new path; today, the paths are very visible and well-established, with deep grooves.

But despite ten years of independent evolution, the grooves formed by nearly every North American collegiate hackathon reveal nearly identical paths, as if trending toward an ideal state of matter.

Inspired by stories like Workflow, people caught on to the fact that building an impressive project at a hackathon could lead to legitimate career opportunities. Hackathon organizers, in turn, began leaning into this, making career growth an explicit goal for attendees.

For the founders and their direct descendants, this didn’t matter because they were there to build interesting things for fun. But this understanding only existed in the minds of those people, and external communications increasingly stressed the career growth benefits of attending a hackathon. This brought in lots of new people who were not briefed on the original visions, and came with the explicit goal of building their resumes. Some of those people later became organizers, further cementing this as the purpose of attending a hackathon.

Today, most collegiate hackathons have fully optimized for feeding into regional recruiting pipelines. They often have an air of faux-professionalism, and projects are built entirely in service of resume building. Many of the hacker clubs that spawned from them are now career prep clubs for CS majors. This new foundation is very well-established, and much more culturally powerful than the original visions ever were: it’s a strong Current reinforced by nearly three full generations of college students.

# Telephone

Telephone is played when the new leader of an org looks to what their org did in previous years and attempts to repeat it without understanding it, thereby watering it down.

Telephone is caused by weak and/or uninspired leadership, and is generally a sign that the org will degrade or fail to meaningfully move forward. Too many years of Telephone will send an org barreling toward dark ages, establishing a dark Current that becomes very difficult to change.

Telephone is exceedingly common in student orgs, which have high turnover rates and no full-time organizers. It’s almost inevitable that every student org will suffer from Telephone at least once in its life, even if it is very strong at one point.

In my opinion, the convergent evolution of North American collegiate hackathons and hacker clubs toward surface-level career prep is a result of multiple generations of Telephone having been played by their respective organizers. Purdue Hackers is currently avoiding this path, but we have no defenses against Telephone—and if we don’t build them, we will inevitably join the path after the current generation graduates. For the long-term future of Purdue Hackers, it’s time to establish a Foundation.

# The Plan

First, because student orgs are especially vulnerable to Telephone, we should assume that some future leaders of Purdue Hackers will play it. Attempting to prevent Telephone altogether is impossible, because it only takes one leader to start a new round, and we can’t control the actions of individuals in the future. Instead, the goal should be to minimize the frequency and effects of Telephone when it is played.

With this in mind, I’ve outlined a plan for building defenses against Telephone, along with an assessment of how Purdue Hackers is doing at each step. I’ve generalized them in hopes that they can also be useful to other club leaders.

## 1. Build a strong culture

Build something people strongly identify with and care about seeing continue. Establish strong values, constantly live them, and reward others for living them. Give people ownership over the org, and allow them to make it their own.

We are doing a great job with this. 80 people show up to Hack Night every week and stay late into the night, often until 6am. The community has become a home for dozens of people, many of whom have made their closest friends. People have been pushed by Hack Night and their friends to build highly ambitious technical projects. Many community members have access to core channels and own major pieces of the org. We have a distinct brand and regularly put out high-quality visual material.

## 2. Write your values and practices down

Do a lot of external comms. Constantly share what your org is doing. Write down specifically what and who your org is for and against, and constantly communicate it. Document technical knowledge. Make all writings very easily accessible to the public. Build all software open source.

Not everyone needs to agree with your written values, but it should be impossible to be a member of your org and not be aware of them.

We have made great strides here, but we need to be doing a lot more.

- let’s assume you can’t stop telephone from happening. one thing you can do is make sure that 1) the culture starts off very strong, 2) do a lot of external comms clearly articulating what you’re for and against. you can’t guarantee that future generations will agree with you, but disagreeing will require them to form their own opinions, which is what you want. and if they still play telephone, they start with great foundations. 3) create interesting and creative programs/initiatives that future generations have to maintain. if they’re playing telephone, the default will be maintaining these great programs. 4) create rituals that people are expected to follow. if they’re playing telephone, the default will be to follow the rituals, which can maintain at least part of the original culture. 5) but ultimately what you really need is strong leadership. you want to make periods of telephone last as short as possible, and you only do that with good leadership. so the process of selecting a new leader needs to be very rigorous, lasting a full year and choosing someone who can be there for a long time.
