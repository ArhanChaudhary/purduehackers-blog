import Test from '../components/test'

This is an MDX file.

Check out my React component:

<Test name="MDX Post test" />

Here I'm going to write a bunch of stuff that fills a couple of lines to see how a real actual blog posts looks like and see if there are any better ways in which I can style it.

Here's the code of the above React component:

```jsx
const Test = ({ name }: { name: string }) => (
  <>
    <h1>
      This is a React component. This post's name is{' '}
      <span className="text-amber-500">{name}</span>.
    </h1>
  </>
)

export default Test
```
