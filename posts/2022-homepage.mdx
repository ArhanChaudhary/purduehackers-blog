ogDescription: Introducing our new homepage üåà

We've been working on a new landing page on and off since August. Today, we want to share it with you.

This website is a labor of love, and its story goes all the way back to May 2022, when we began searching for inspiration for new branding for Purdue Hackers.

At the time, our homepage looked like this:

It wasn't a disaster, but it also didn't communicate the soul and magic that we wanted people to take away in their first impression of Purdue Hackers. We wanted to follow it up with something great.

We were inspired by [blocks.css](https://thesephist.github.io/blocks.css), bright colors, and high-contrast elements. With these in mind, in late August we began working on the website.

Making this website was an enormous challenge. Each new section required thinking about three things at once: what story it should tell, what aesthetic it should have, and how to actually build it. In addition, building this website was also the primary means through which we were figuring out our new brand identity‚Äîso this website was actually two major projects masquerading as one.

Typically, companies & web design agencies that embark on a project at this scale do it over months of sustained work, with a team of designers creating countless Figma mockups, and a team of web designers working to implement those designs. A rebranding project alone is often a sustained months-long process before they even begin thinking about the website.

We were three people, who are not designers, figuring out as we went along. As a result, work on this website was on and off throughout the Fall 2022 semester.

The hero was the first thing we built, and has been unchanged since August. The call to action at the bottom of the page, the email section, and the Hack Night section, were built throughout the first half of October. The workshops section was built at the end of November. Finally, the community section and a slightly revised Hack Night section were built in early December, just before the website shipped.
