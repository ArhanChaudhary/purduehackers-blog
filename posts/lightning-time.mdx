Three weeks ago, we created <span className="lightning-gradient">Lightning Time</span> ‚ö°Ô∏è, a new way to measure time. Today, we want to share Lightning Time with you.

# What is Lightning Time?

Lightning Time is a spin on hexadecimal time: the day is split into 16 parts, then 16 again, then 16 again, and so on. The first and largest
unit of Lightning Time is called a <span className="bolt">bolt</span>; the second unit is called a <span className="zap">zap</span>; the third is called a <span className="spark">spark</span>; and the fourth is
called a **charge**.

To illustrate: the current time in your timezone is <ColoredLightningString />.

A typical Lightning Time string looks like this: **8~0~0|e**, or **8~0~0** without charges.

The three major units‚Äîbolts, zaps, and sparks‚Äîare each delimited by a tilde `~`. Smaller units are delimited by a single pipe `|`.
The charge is the only named unit after the pipe, but you can go down as far as you want. For example, **8~0~0|ef4** is a
valid Lightning Time string.

Charges are kind of like seconds: you can include them (and smaller units beyond them) if you want to be more precise,
but most of the time you can omit them.

Lightning Time is timezone-specific; it's not like UTC, where one timezone is the universal timezone.
**8~0~0** (12pm) eastern time is **6~0~0** (9am) pacific time.

## Colors

Where we think Lightning Time really stands out is that you can represent it with colors! üåà
(Did you notice all of the colors above are changing?)

Because Lightning Time is just hexadecimal time, we can represent the current time as a color,
since any 6-digit hexadecimal string is also a color. We don't want to represent the time as one color, though‚Äîif we did,
the color would often look ugly. Instead, **Lightning Time represents time as three colors.**

A typical hexadecimal color looks something like <span className="font-bold text-[#5c10e8]">#5c10e8</span>. Many people see hexadecimal colors as some kind of magic color-producing code‚Äîbut,
in reality, a hexadecimal color is just the hexadecimal representation of a color's RGB values! Each RGB value gets two hexadecimal digits,
because RGB goes from 0-255 (AKA 256 possible combinations), hexadecimal goes from 0-15 (AKA 16 possible combinations),
and 16\*16 = 256.

Try it yourself! Convert `5c`, `10`, and `e8` [from hexadecimal to decimal](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html), and you'll get the RGB values of the color! In this case,
it's `(R:92, G:16, B:232)`.

Let's say the current time is **8~e~2|f**. Lightning Time begins by filling in the red, green, and blue respective values of
each color with the four units. It looks something like this:

![a screenshot of handwriting in a digital notebook, showing three rows with six spaces for values. the first two (red value) of the
first one are filled in by 8e, the middle two (green value) of the second one are filled in by e2, and the last two (blue value)
of the third one are filled in by 2f.](/posts/lightning-time/colors-unfilled.jpeg)

In this example, the red value of the first color is `8e`; the green value of the second color is `e2`; and the blue value
of the third color is `2f`.

This leaves the other two RGB values of each color open, **which you can fill in with whatever you want!** The values you
fill in will remain static, while the respective red, green, and blue values of each color will change from `00` to `ff` according
to the current time.

![an expanded screenshot of the same notebook. on the left is the table from earlier. on the right is a new table with the
full color filled in for all three values.](/posts/lightning-time/colors-filled.jpeg)

Here's a demo of how the colors work, using your local time:

<ColorsDemo />

The static values in this demo are the same as the values highlighted in teal in the image above‚Äîthey're the values
we've picked for Purdue Hackers, and the default across the Lightning Time tooling we've built. (AKA, you don't have to come up
with your own colors when you use Lightning Time; you can just use our default colors.) But you can replace them with anything!

This is where Lightning Time gets _really_ magical: represent time not just as any three colors, but as _your_ favorite three colors! ü§Ø‚ú®

## Play with Lightning Time ü™Å‚ö°Ô∏è

If you want to get more of a feel for how Lightning Time colors work, try playing around with them! Below are the default static color
values for Lightning Time represented as RGB values, along with the full color when the dynamic value is
`00`, `40`, `80`, `c0`, and `f0`. Try changing all the numbers and see if you can find a color combination that looks good to you. üåà

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4 font-main mx-auto">
  <ColorToy part={LightningPart.Bolt} defaultValues={[161, 0]} />
  <ColorToy part={LightningPart.Zap} defaultValues={[50, 214]} />
  <ColorToy part={LightningPart.Spark} defaultValues={[246, 133]} />
</div>

Below is also a tool to help you convert between traditional time and Lightning Time. Pick some of your favorite times and convert
between them üòé Bonus points: pay attention to how the gradient border changes as you do it to get even more of a feel for how
the colors work.

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4 mx-auto">
  <ConvertToLightning />
  <ConvertFromLightning />
</div>

Some fun facts while you're playing with those:

- One bolt lasts exactly 90 minutes, because instead of splitting the day into 24 parts, Lightning Time splits it into 16 parts, and 24/16 = 1.5.
- Zaps and sparks don't map very well to traditional time; one zap lasts a little over 5 minutes, and one spark lasts about 21 seconds.
- One charge lasts about one second and a half.
- 12:00 PM is **8~0~0** because it's midday, and 8 is half of 16.

## Tools

If you use Raycast, we made a Raycast extension for converting to/from Lightning Time &
working with colors. You can [install it here](https://github.com/MatthewStanciu/raycast-lightning-time).

Finally: if you want to use Lightning Time in your own projects, **we published an npm package**: `@purduehackers/time`.
(This post is using that package! üòé) [Check it out on npm.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@purduehackers/time) More languages coming soon üëÄ

# How we made Lightning Time

Purdue Hackers is a student organization at Purdue University full of weirdo creatives who make things together. Every Friday night,
we run an event called **Hack Night** üåô, during which we build projects, contribute to open source, and let our imaginations
run wild. üß†

At [our third Hack Night](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-03), a couple of us got together and began brainstorming
new ways to think about time. We typically divide time into 24 hours, 60 minutes, 60 seconds, etc‚Äîbut there are countless ways
to break a day up.

We considered a handful of theories: What if we XOR the Unix epoch and normal time? What if time were circular, AKA goes up to
a certain point, then goes back down? What if time were multidimensional (AKA rode a sine wave or something of an even higher dimension)?

Eventually, we settled on hexadecimal time, primarily because of the countless ways you can manipulate hexadecimal numbers
to end up with a color (<span className="lightning-gradient">or three</span>). We considered a few different ways to represent
time as a color before eventually landing on Lightning Time's three-color system.

Finally, we settled on the tilde `~` and pipe `|` delimeters, and decided our new time system would be called Lightning Time.

While we were brainstorming all of this, one of us built a clock. That clock (with some minor styling & color changes) is what's
inside the iframe at the top of this post, and lives at [lightning-time.vercel.app](https://lightning-time.vercel.app).

  middle of the page, and the background of the page is a gradient of the three colors representing
  that time.](/posts/lightning-time/original-clock.jpeg)

Lightning Time wasn't created by one person; it was created by _all of us_, in a truly magical way.

Many of us grew up never having found our people until we were united by our shared love for making things. But finding the time and
energy to actually make things is often really difficult. We want being part of Purdue Hackers to feel like being part of a
magical universe where you carve out real time in your day to build & ship creative & technical projects with friendly and
interesting people. Coming together at Hack Night to build a new time system is one of the ways in which this guiding philosophy
manifested.

We don't expect Lightning Time to be used by anyone outside our universe, but we think it's really cool, and it's here for you
if you want to use it. And if you go to Purdue and have stumbled across this post, we hope you'll check out Purdue Hackers :)
