Two weeks ago, we created <span className="font-bold lightning-gradient">Lightning Time</span> ‚ö°Ô∏è, a new way to measure time. Today, we want to share Lightning Time with you.

# What is Lightning Time?

At its core, Lightning Time is just hexadecimal time: the day is split into 16 parts, then 16 again, then 16 again. The first and largest
unit of Lightning Time is called a **bolt**; the second unit is called a **zap**; the third is called a **spark**; and the fourth is
called a **charge**.

A typical lightning time string looks like this: `8~0~0|e`.

# How Lightning Time was created

Every Friday night, Purdue Hackers runs an event called **Hack Night** üåô.
During the event, students work together to build their own projects, contribute to open source, and let their imaginations run wild. üß†

At [our third Hack Night](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-03), a couple of us got together and began brainstorming
new ways to think about time. We typically divide time into 24 hours, 60 minutes, 60 seconds, etc‚Äîbut there are countless ways
to break a day up. After a couple of hours of brainstorming together, we landed on Lightning Time.

Lightning Time wasn't created by one person; it was created by _all of us_, truly in the best possible way.
