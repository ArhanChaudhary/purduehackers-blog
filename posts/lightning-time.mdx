Two weeks ago, we created Lightning Time ⚡️, a new way to measure time. Today, we want to share Lightning Time with you.

# How Lightning Time was created

Every Friday night, Purdue Hackers runs an event called **Hack Night** 🌙.
During the event, students work together to build their own projects, contribute to open source, and let their imaginations run wild. 🧠

At [our third Hack Night](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-03), a couple of us got together and began brainstorming
new ways to think about time. We typically divide time into 24 hours, 60 minutes, 60 seconds, etc—but there are countless ways
to break a day up. After a couple of hours of brainstorming together, we landed on Lightning Time.
