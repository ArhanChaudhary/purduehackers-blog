Two weeks ago, we created <span className="font-bold lightning-gradient">Lightning Time</span> ‚ö°Ô∏è, a new way to measure time. Today, we want to share Lightning Time with you.

# What is Lightning Time?

Lightning Time is a variation of hexadecimal time: the day is split into 16 parts, then 16 again, then 16 again, and so on. The first and largest
unit of Lightning Time is called a <span className="bolt">bolt</span>; the second unit is called a <span className="zap">zap</span>; the third is called a <span className="spark">spark</span>; and the fourth is
called a **charge**.

To illustrate: the current time in your timezone is <ColoredLightningString />.

Charges are kind of like seconds: you can include them (and smaller units beyond them) if you want to be more precise, but most of the time you can omit them.

A typical Lightning Time string looks like this: **8~0~0|e**, or **8~0~0** without charges.

Like "normal" time, Lightning Time is timezone-specific; it is not intended to be a replacement for UTC. **8~0~0** eastern time is **6~0~0** pacific time.

## Colors

The super fun part about Lightning Time is that you can represent it with colors! üåà (Did you notice all of the colors above are changing?)

Because Lightning Time is a variation of hexadecimal time, we can represent the current time as a color,
since any 6-digit hexadecimal string is also a color. We don't want to represent the time as one color, though‚Äîif we did,
the color would often look bad. Instead, **Lightning Time represents time as three colors.**

A typical hexadecimal color looks something like <span className="font-bold text-[#5c10e8]">#5c10e8</span>. Many people see hexadecimal colors as some kind of magic color-producing code‚Äîbut,
in reality, a hexadecimal color is just the hexadecimal representation of a color's RGB values! Each RGB value gets two hexadecimal digits,
because RGB goes from 0-255 (AKA 256 possible combinations), a hexadecimal string goes from 0-15 (AKA 16 possible combinations),
and 16\*16=256.

Try it yourself! Convert `5c`, `10`, and `e8` [from hexadecimal to decimal](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html), and you'll get the RGB values of the color! In this case,
it's `(R:92, G:16, B:232)`.

Let's say the current time is **8~e~2|f**. Lightning Time begins by filling in the red, green, and blue respective values of
each colors in with these four values. It looks something like this:

![](/posts/lightning-time/colors-unfilled.jpeg)

In this example, the red value of the first color is `8e`; the green value of the second color is `e2`; and the blue value
of the third color is `2f`.

This leaves the other two RGB values of each color open. So what are those filled in with? **Whatever you want!** The values you
fill in will remain static, while the respective red, green, and blue values of each color will change from `00` to `ff` according
to the current time.

Here's a demo of how the colors work, using your local time:

<ColorsDemo />

The static values in this demo are the values we've picked for Purdue Hackers, and the default across the Lightning Time tooling
we've built. But you can replace them with anything!

This is where Lightning Time gets _really_ magical: represent time not just as any three colors, but as _your_ favorite three colors! ü§Ø‚ú®

## Play with Lightning Time ü™Å‚ö°Ô∏è

If you want to get more of a feel for how Lightning Time colors work, try playing around with them! Below are the default static color
values for Lightning Time represented as RGB values, along with the full color when the dynamic value is
`00`, `40`, `80`, `c0`, and `f0`. Try changing all the numbers and see if you can find a color combination that looks good to you. üåà

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4 font-main mx-auto">
  <ColorToy part={LightningPart.Bolt} defaultValues={[161, 0]} />
  <ColorToy part={LightningPart.Zap} defaultValues={[50, 214]} />
  <ColorToy part={LightningPart.Spark} defaultValues={[246, 133]} />
</div>

We also built a tool to convert to & from Lightning Time if you want to play around with it some more.
Some fun facts: one bolt lasts exactly 90 minutes (because Lightning Time splits the day into 16 parts instead of 24, and 24/16 = 1.5),
and 12:00 PM is **8~0~0**, because it's midday and 8 is half of 16.

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4 mx-auto">
  <ConvertToLightning />
  <ConvertFromLightning />
</div>

If you use Raycast, we also made a Raycast extension for converting to/from Lightning Time &
getting colors. You can [install it here](https://github.com/MatthewStanciu/raycast-lightning-time).

Finally: **we published an npm package**, `@purduehackers/time`, which allows you to use Lightning Time in your code.
This post is using that package! üòé [Check it out on npm.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@purduehackers/time) More languages coming soon üëÄ

# How we made Lightning Time

Every Friday night, Purdue Hackers runs an event called **Hack Night** üåô.
During the event, students work together to build their own projects, contribute to open source, and let their imaginations run wild. üß†

At [our third Hack Night](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-03), a couple of us got together and began brainstorming
new ways to think about time. We typically divide time into 24 hours, 60 minutes, 60 seconds, etc‚Äîbut there are countless ways
to break a day up. After a couple of hours of brainstorming together, we landed on Lightning Time.

![Three people huddled around a table. The person in the middle is at a
  computer, everyone else is looking at what they are
  doing.](/posts/lightning-time/hack-night-brainstorming.jpeg)

Lightning Time wasn't created by one person; it was created by _all of us_, truly in the best possible way.

# Why we made Lightning Time

Many of us grew up never having found our people until we were united by our shared love for making things. But actually making
things as a student is really difficult, especially if you're in a rigorous program like Purdue Computer Science.
You have to have an idea that you find interesting, that's feasible to build, and that teaches you new things, but not too many
new things, otherwise you'll get overwhelmed and give up. Then you actually have to build the thing, all while
being pulled in every direction by academic and social obligations.

We want being part of Purdue Hackers to feel like being part of a magical, friendly, and creative universe, where you carve out
real time in your day to build & ship creative & technical projects. Coming together at Hack Night to build a new time system is one of the ways
in which this manifests.

We don't expect Lightning Time to be used by anyone outside our universe, but it's here for you if you want to use it.
And if you go to Purdue and have stumbled across this post, we hope you'll check out Purdue Hackers :)
