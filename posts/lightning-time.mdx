Two weeks ago, we created <span className="font-bold lightning-gradient">Lightning Time</span> ‚ö°Ô∏è, a new way to measure time. Today, we want to share Lightning Time with you.

# What is Lightning Time?

At its core, Lightning Time is just hexadecimal time: the day is split into 16 parts, then 16 again, then 16 again. The first and largest
unit of Lightning Time is called a <span className="bolt">bolt</span>; the second unit is called a <span className="zap">zap</span>; the third is called a <span className="spark">spark</span>; and the fourth is
called a **charge**.

Charges are kind of like seconds: you can include them (and smaller units beyond them) if you want to be more precise, but most of the time you can omit them.

A typical lightning time string looks like this: `8~0~0|e`‚Äîor `8~0~0` without charges.

Here's the current time made up of all the parts: <LightningText part={LightningPart.Bolt} />~<LightningText
  part={LightningPart.Zap}
/>~<LightningText part={LightningPart.Spark} />|<LightningText
  part={LightningPart.Charge}
/>

# How Lightning Time was created

Every Friday night, Purdue Hackers runs an event called **Hack Night** üåô.
During the event, students work together to build their own projects, contribute to open source, and let their imaginations run wild. üß†

At [our third Hack Night](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-03), a couple of us got together and began brainstorming
new ways to think about time. We typically divide time into 24 hours, 60 minutes, 60 seconds, etc‚Äîbut there are countless ways
to break a day up. After a couple of hours of brainstorming together, we landed on Lightning Time.

Lightning Time wasn't created by one person; it was created by _all of us_, truly in the best possible way.
